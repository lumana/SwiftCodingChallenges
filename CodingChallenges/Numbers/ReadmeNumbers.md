# Challenge 16: Fizz Buzz

**Difficulty:**  Easy
Write a function that counts from 1 through 100, and prints “Fizz” if the counter is evenly divisible by 3, “Buzz” if it’s evenly divisible by 5, “Fizz Buzz” if it’s even divisible by three and five, or the counter number for all other cases.

**Sample input and output**
• 1 should print “1”
• 2 should print “2”
• 3 should print “Fizz”
• 4 should print “4”
• 5 should print “Buzz”
• 15 should print “Fizz Buzz”

# Challenge 17: Generate a random number in a range

**Difficulty:**  Easy
Write a function that accepts positive minimum and maximum integers, and returns a random
number between those two bounds, inclusive.

**Sample input and output**
• Given minimum 1 and maximum 5, the return values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are valid. • Given minimum 8 and maximum 10, the return values 8, 9, 10 are valid.
• Given minimum 12 and maximum 12, the return value 12 is valid.
• Given minimum 12 and maximum 18, the return value 7 is invalid.

# Challenge 18: Recreate the pow() function

**Difficulty:**  Easy
Create a function that accepts positive two integers, and raises the first to the power of the
second.

**Sample input and output**
• The inputs 4 and 3 should return 64, i.e. 4 multiplied by itself 3 times.
• The inputs 2 and 8 should return 256, i.e. 2 multiplied by itself 8 times.
